* Visual Audio Assist for Street Fighter 6

An accessibility tool that reads out your opponent's info and monitors health during matches.

* What it does

- Reads your opponent's control type (Classic/Modern) and rank when the VS screen appears
- Works with all ranks including Master players with MR ratings
- Alerts you when either player hits critical health (yellow bar)
- Can announce training menu options as you navigate them

* Requirements

*IMPORTANT:* You need to run SF6 in fullscreen at 1920x1080 resolution. The program won't work correctly at other resolutions.

* Setup

1. Download the release for your OS (Windows/Linux)
2. Run the program
3. When the name capture wizard starts, just follow along:
   - Open any replay where you're on the LEFT side
   - Wait for the VS screen to show up
   - That's it - your name gets saved automatically
4. Done! The program will now work during actual matches

The wizard has audio that walks you through everything.

* How to use

Just leave it running in the background while you play. When a match loads and the VS screen appears, you'll hear your opponent's info. During the match, if either player gets to critical health, you'll get an alert in the corresponding ear (left player = left audio channel, right player = right audio channel).

* If something goes wrong

If name detection seems off, delete MyName.png and run the program again to redo the capture wizard.

* Notes

Detection is pretty accurate but might occasionally mess up with weird stage lighting or backgrounds. This is just how image recognition goes sometimes.
